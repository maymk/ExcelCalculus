      <p>
        With functions of one variable we were interested in places where the derivative is zero,
        since they made candidate points for the maximum or minimum of a function.
        If the derivative is not zero, we have a direction that is downhill and moving a little in that direction gives a lower value of the function.
        Similarly, with functions of two variables we can only find a minimum or maximum for a function if both partial derivatives are 0 at the same time.
        Such points are called critical points.
      </p>

      <assemblage>
        <p>
          The point <m>(a,b)</m> is a <term>critical point</term> for the multivariable function <m>f(x,y)</m>,
          if both partial derivatives are 0 at the same time.

          and
          <me>\frac{\partial }{\partial y} f(x,y)|_{x=a,y=b}=0</me>.

                  If the partials are more complicated, I will want to find the critical points another way.

                  To get solver to set both partials to 0 at the same time, I ask it to solve for <m>f_y=0</m>,

                <title>Determining the Critical Point is a Minimum</title>
                <p>
                  We thus get a critical point at <m>(9/4,-1/4)</m> with any of the three methods of solving for both partial derivatives being zero at the same time.
                  Once we have a critical point we want to determine if it is a maximum, minimum, or something else.
                  The easiest way is to look at the graph near the critical point.
                </p>

                <image width="100%" source="images/sec-6-3-5.png"/>

                <p>It is clear from the graph that this critical point is a local minimum.</p>
              </li>
            </dl>
          </p>
        </solution>
      </example>

      <p>
        It is easy to see that <m>f(x,y)=x^2+y^2</m> has a critical point at <m>(0,0)</m> and that that point is a minimum for the function.
        Similarly, <m>f(x,y)=-x^2-y^2</m> has a critical point at <m>(0,0)</m> and that that point is a maximum for the function.
        For some functions, like <m>f(x,y)=x^2-y^2</m>, which has a critical point at <m>(0,0)</m>,
        we can have a maximum in one direction and a minimum in another direction.
        Such a point is called a <term>saddle point</term>.
        We note that we can have a saddle point even if the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> slice curves both indicate a minimum.
      </p>

      <example>
        <title>A Saddle Point at a Minimum on Both Axes</title>
        <statement>
          <figure>
            <caption>Video presentation of this example</caption>
            <video youtube="ThmQTWWOvYw"/>
          </figure>

          <p>
            Show that <m>f(x,y)=x^2-3xy+y^2</m> has a critical point at <m>(0,0)</m>,
            which is a minimum of both slice curves, but is not a local minimum.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We look at the two partial derivatives, and notice they are both zero at the origin.
            <md>
              <mrow>\frac{\partial }{\partial x} f(x,y) \amp = 2x-3y</mrow>
              <mrow>\frac{\partial }{\partial x} f(x,y) \amp = -3x+2y</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>

          <p>
            We then see that both slice curves are parabolas that bend up, with a minimum at 0.
            <md>
              <mrow>f(x,0) \amp = x^2</mrow>
              <mrow>f(0,y) \amp = y^2</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>

          <p>
            However if we take the slice with <m>x=y</m>,
            we get a parabola bending down, so we don’t have a minimum.
            <me>f(x,-x)=x^2-3x x+x^2=-x^2</me>.
            Looking at the graph, we see that this graph does not have a minimum.

      <title>Second Partial Derivatives</title>

      <p>
        With only first derivatives, we can just find the critical points.
        To check if a critical point is maximum, a minimum, or a saddle point, using only the first derivative,
        the best method is to look at a graph to determine the kind of critical point.
        For some applications we want to categorize the critical points symbolically.
      </p>

      <p>
        With functions of one variable we used the second derivative to test if a critical point was a maximum or minimum.
        In the two variable case we need to define the second derivatives
        and use them to define the discriminant of a function to test if a critical point is a minimum, maximum, or saddle point.
        We first need to define second partial derivatives.
      </p>

        <title>Second partials</title>
        <p>
          <me> f_{ab}=(f_a )_b=\frac{\partial}{\partial b}(\frac{\partial}{\partial a} f)</me>.
        </p>
      </assemblage>

      <p>
        Note that <m>f_{xx}</m> is simply the old second derivative of the curve <m>f(x,y_0)</m> and
        <m>f_{yy}</m> is simply the old second derivative of the curve <m>f(x_0,y)</m>.
        For functions with continuous second partial derivatives, the mixed partials,
        <m>f_{yx}</m> and <m>f_{xy}</m> are the same.
      </p>

      <example>
        <title>Finding Second Partial Derivatives</title>
        <statement>
          <p>

          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We start by computing the first partial derivatives.

            </md>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Then we compute the second partial derivatives.

              <mrow>f_{xx} \amp = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} f_x=2</mrow>

              <mrow>f_{yy} \amp = \frac{\partial}{\partial y} f_y=30y</mrow>
            </md>.
            As expected, the mixed partials are the same.

                  <p>
                    We can use either the method of substitution
                    (solve for <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> in one equation and substitute into the other and solve),
                    or method by elimination (multiply both equations by carefully chosen numbers and add/subtract the equations from each other.)
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    We will demonstrate method of elimination:
                    <md>
                      <mrow>-1×(2x+2y+5 \amp = 0)  \amp     \text{gives }-2x-2y-5\amp=0</mrow>
                      <mrow>1×(2x+8y-6 \amp = 0)  \amp    \text{gives } 2x+8y-6\amp =0</mrow>
                    </md>.
                    Adding the two equations gives <m>6y-11=0</m>;
                    hence,  <m>y=  11/6</m>.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Pick one of the equations to solve for x (it does not matter which one):
                    <me>2x+2y+5=0  \quad \text{and }y=  11/6</me>
                    implies that   <m>2x+2(11/6)+5=0</m>  so <m>x=  (2(11/6)+5)/(-2)=-13/3</m>.
                  </p>

                  <p>We can also solve this system of equations using Wolfram Alpha:</p>

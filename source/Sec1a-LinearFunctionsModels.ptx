    <introduction>
      <p>
        We will start this chapter with a review of linear functions, which are common in business.
        In business there are quite a few examples of linear equations.
        We start by reviewing some standard concepts related to lines, including the slope.
      </p>

      <p>
        Following the conventions of microeconomics, we will often use the variables q and p,
        for quantity and  price, rather than x and y.
        We will also follow the conventions of economics in treating quantity as the independent variable.
        (The q-axis will be the horizontal axis.  A fast web search for supply and demand equilibrium will convince you this standard usage.)

    </introduction>

    <subsection><title>Equations of a line</title>

      <p>
        From prior courses, such as college algebra,
        you will remember that lines can be written in several different forms.
        If we are given the slope and the <m>y</m>-intercept,
        the slope intercept form will be the equation of choice.
        If we are given a point and a slope, it might be faster if we use the point-slope form of a line.

        In a business setting we are likely to use <m>q</m> instead of <m>x</m> and <m>p</m> instead of <m>y</m>.

        With this notation these standard equations of a line become:

        <title>Supply and Demand Curves</title>
        <p>
          Supply and demand equations are often modeled by linear equations.
          The supply function is a line with a positive slope, and the demand function is a line with a negative slope.

        <p>
          The vertical axis shows the price, the horizontal axis shows quantity.
          Both supply (S) and demand (D) are linear functions.
          In this diagram <sq>B</sq> denotes a surplus of supply, and <sq>A</sq> denotes a surplus of demand.

        Recall, that the slope of a line through the points <m>P_0=(q_0,p_0)</m> and <m>P_1=(q_1,p_1)</m> is given by:

        There are two other forms of a line that are sometimes used.
        The general form of a line is a standard notation used in mathematics.
        The 2-point form of a line is very handy in those situations where we are not given a slope,
        but we are given information about two points that lie on the line.

        <title>Finding four versions of a line</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            We find that we can sell 150 widgets a day if we sell them at $10.
            If we raise the price to $15, we can only sell 110 widgets a day.
            Assume that there is a linear relationship between price and quantity sold.
            Find the equation of the line in all four forms.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution  xml:id="SolutionFindingFourVersionsOfALine">
          <p>
            Writing this using our variables <m>p</m> (price) and <m>q</m> (quantity of widgets)
            we see that when <m>p = 10</m>, <m>q = 150</m> and when <m>p = 15</m>, <m>q = 110</m>.
            Points are (usually) given as <m>(q,p)</m>, so this means we have two point <m>(150,10)</m> and <m>(110,15)</m> on the line.
            We always need to find the slope of the line, and in this case
            <me>
              m=  \frac{15-10}{110-150}=  \frac{5}{-40}= \frac{-1}{8}
            </me>.
          </p>

          <p>
            We are given two points, so the 2-point form of the line should be the easiest formula to find:
            <me>
              p-p_0=\frac{p_1-p_0}{q_1-q_0 }(q-q_0)
            </me>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In our case this becomes:
            <me>
              p-10=\frac{15-10}{110-150}(q-150)
            </me>.
          </p>

          <p>
            We just found the slope and we just need to pick a point <m>(p_0,q_0)</m> to finish the problem.
            (Recall that <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are the variables, so we want to leave those as they are.)
            In this case lets pick <m>(p_0,q_0)= (150,10)</m>.
            Then we get this simplified version, which is also the point-slope form of this line.
            <me>
              p-10=\frac{-1}{8}(q-150)
            </me>.
          </p>

          <p>
            From here we can very easily find the slope intercept form by some straight-forward algebra:
            <m>p-10=\frac{-1}{8}(q-150)</m> implies that
            <me>
              p=\frac{-1}{8} (q-150)+10=  \frac{-1}{8} q+  \frac{150}{8}+10=  \frac{-1}{8} q+\frac{230}{8}
            </me>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus
            <me>
              p=  \frac{-1}{8} q+\frac{230}{8}
            </me>.
          </p>

          <p>
            And finally the general form will be another exercise in algebra.
            We clear the fractions and put everything on one side.
            <me>
              8p+q-230=0
            </me>.

        <title>Finding a line from two points</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Suppose that a linear cost-quantity relationship exists in producing widgets.
            There is a fixed cost of $400.  There is also a per-unit cost of $11.

                 <p>
                   We have one point of the form (quantity, cost) at (0, 400) from the fixed cost.
                   This point happens to be an intercept.  The slope of the line is <m>m=11/1=11</m>.
                   We will let <m>C</m> stand for Cost and <m>q</m> stand for quantity.
                   The general formula for a line with these variables will have the form
                   <me>C=m q+b.</me>
                 </p>

                 <p>
                   In this example <m>m = 11</m> and <m>b = 400</m>,
                   hence the equation of the line is
                   <me>C=11 q+400</me>

                  For this example we will use <q>designer variables</q>, longer variables that make the equation easier to read.
                  The output will be Pay, and the input variable <mdash/> the number of hours worked <mdash/> will be hrs.
                  We are told that Pay = 500 when hrs = 40. The slope of the line for work beyond 40 hours is <m>m=18</m>.
                  Another way to think of this is to say that there is a fixed Pay of $500 and a variable Pay for any hours in excess of 40:
                  <ie/> (hrs - 40). Thus, the equation of the line, according to the point-slope form is
                  <me>\text{Pay} = \text{variable  pay} + \text{Fixed  pay}</me>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This gives us
                  <me>
                    \text{Pay}=m(\text{hrs}-40)+500=18*(\text{hrs}-40)+500

              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The pay for working 56 hours is 18(56-40)+500=$788.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The pay for working 30 hours is $500.
                  This is a trick question part of the problem.
                  From the text of the problem, the linear model only works for overtime,
                  with a flat rate applying to less than 40 hours per week.
                  Comment: The function should be written as a piecewise defined function.

      <p>
        It can be useful when writing reports to have variables that convey some meaning.
        We could have used <m>y</m> for <m>\operatorname{Pay}</m>, and <m>x</m> for <m>\operatorname{hrs}</m>,
        but using the much more easily interpreted variables named Pay and hrs helps when reading the formulas.

                    =  \frac{17-5}{6-2}=\frac{12}{4}=3</m>

                <li>
                  <p>Next we find the equation of the line. There are several ways to do this and two methods are outlined below.</p>
                  <p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <p>
                          Method 1: use the point-slope equation: <m>p-p_0=m (q-q_0)</m>.
                          We can choose either one of the points,
                          so in this case we will find the line using the point <m>(q_0,p_0 )=(2,5)</m>.
                          This gives the equation <m>p-5=3 (q-2)</m>.
                        </p>
                        <p>Rewrite this as <m>p=3q-1</m></p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>
                          Method 2: use the slope- intercept equation <m>p=m q+b</m>.
                          Use <m>(q,p)=(2,5)</m> and <m>m = 3</m> and solve for <m>b</m>:
                          <m>5=3 (2)+b</m>.
                          And solving for <m>b</m> we have that <m>b= -1</m>, and hence <m>p=3q-1</m>

            Suppose that the relationship between price and quantity of widgets sold is linear.
            When the price is $23, we can sell 4783 widgets.  If we raise the price to $27, we can only sell 4295 widgets.
            Find the equation of the line.

            The information tells us we have two points: <m>(q,p)=(4783,23)</m>  and <m>(q,p)=(4295,27)</m>.
            (Note that in business the quantity <m>q</m> is usually the input and price <m>p</m> is usually the output.)</p>
            <p>Next we need the slope: <m>m=  (27-23)/(4295-4783)=4/(-488)=-1/122</m></p>
            <p>
              Using <m>p-p_0=m (q-q_0 )</m>   we get <m>p-23=-1/122  (q-4783)</m>.
              We can rewrite the latter as <m>p=23-1/122  (q-4783)</m>.

            Suppose that the relationship between price and quantity of gizmo kits we can buy is linear.
            When the price is $15, we can buy 6000 gizmo kits.
            If we lower the price we will pay to $13, we can only buy 4500 kits.

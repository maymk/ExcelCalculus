                <xref ref="FunctionSevVarFormula">Formulas in a cell can refer to several cells</xref>, allowing you to create and evaluate functions of several variables. You  can see a <xref ref="BankBalanceVideo">screencast of the example</xref>.

        <subsection ><title><term>Making a table for a function of 2 variable</term></title>
            <p>
                To make a <xref ref="TwoVarTableFormulas">table of values</xref> I need to construck an array where one variable is horizontal (Row 2 in the example), and the other variable is vertical (Column A in the example).  The variabkles are then semi-absolute in the formula, with a dollar sign before either the row or column as needed.  You  can see a <xref ref="BankBalanceVideo">screencast of the example</xref>.

        <subsection ><title><term>Turning a table of a function of 2 variables into a surface graph</term></title>
            <p>
                Once we have made a table of of values for a function of two variables, we would like to turn it into a 3-D graph.  We start with a <xref ref ="TableForGraph1">table like found above</xref>.We then <xref ref="TableForGraph2">move the varable names out of the corner</xref> into adjacent rows and columns.  Highlight the table, including the values of hte cariables.  Then insert a chart, choosing the appropriate chart type.  You can choose <xref ref="SurfaceGraph">3-D surface chart</xref>, a <xref ref="WireFrameGraph">3_D wire frame chart</xref>, or a <xref ref="ContourGraph">contour chart</xref>.  You  can see a <xref ref="TableToGraphVideo">screencast of the example</xref>.

        <title>From Section 6.3 - Critical points and extrema</title>
        <p>
            You can <term>use solver to solve a system of equations</term>.  
            You need to set the problem up with <xref ref="CritPointFormula">the set of input variables and the equation of the system</xref>. Then you call Solver and <xref ref="CritPointConstraints">use all but one of the fromulas as constraints on the system</xref>.  You  can see a <xref ref="CritPointsVideo">screencast of the example</xref>.

        <p>
            Sheets does not seem to hae a reasonable way of producing 3-D graphs.  For the other spreadsheet skills in this chapter, Excel and Sheets behave the same way.

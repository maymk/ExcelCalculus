    <p>
      In the last section we looked at using the partial derivatives to find the maximum or minimum of a function in several variables.
      This is an extension of the optimization problems we did with functions of a single variable.
      It is worthwhile to take another look at best fitting curves or trendlines,
      a process Excel has been doing throughout the course and see that it is a particular example of optimization.
      This will let us to best fitting curves that use models other than the ones used by the <c>trendline</c> command.

      <title>Definition of Best Fitting Curve</title>

      <p>
        Before we can find the curve that is best fitting to a set of data,
        we need to understand how <q>best fitting</q> is defined.
        We start with the simplest nontrivial example.  We consider a data set of 3 points,
        <m>{(1,0),(3,5),(6,5)}</m> and a line that we will use to predict the y-value given the x-value,
        <m>\predicted(x)=x/2 +1</m>.  We want to determine how well the line matches that data.
        For each point, <m>(x_i,y_i)</m>, in the set we start by finding the corresponding point,
        <m>(x_i,\predicted(x_i ))</m>, on the line.
      </p>

      <p>
        This gives us a set of predicted points, <m>{(1,1.5),(3,2.5),(6,4)}</m>.
      </p>

      <image width="80%" source="images/sec-6-4-1.png"/>

      <p>
        For each point we now compute the difference between the actual y-values and the predicted y-values.
        Our errors are the lengths of the brown segments in the picture, in this case <m>{3/2,3/2,1}</m>.
        Finally we add the squares of the errors, <m>9/4+9/4+1=11/2</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The best fitting line is defined to be the line that that minimizes the sum of the squares of the error.
        If we are trying to fit the data with a different model, we want to choose the equation from that model that minimizes the sum of the squares of the error.
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <p>
      Now that we have a definition we want to look at fitting a line to a simple data set in three ways.
      We will start with the data set of three points:

    </tabular>

    <p>
      We want to start with the familiar method, using the <c>trendline</c> command from a graph.
      Then we want to use solver to minimize the sum of squared errors.
      Finally, we want to look at the function for sum of squared errors to see how we find the line using partial derivatives.
      After we have looked at all three approaches for this first example, we will consider more complicated examples.

          The <c>trendline</c> command tells us the slope should be 2 and the intercept should be 1.

          We need to add the predicting equation to use solver .
          We start with a randomly chosen slope and intercept for our prediction line.
          Our table has a PredictedY column, which gives the value that would be on the line with our slope and intercept.
          We add in the error, which is the difference between the predicted y and the actual y, and the square of the error.
          We then take the sum of the squares of the errors.
        </p>

        <image width="70%" source="images/sec-6-4-3.png"/>

        <p>
          Our use of Solver is similar to when we were looking for a minimum of a function of one variable.
          We need to designate the cell with the value we want to minimize.  We select the button to minimize.
          Recall that Solver selects the "Make unconstrained variables non-negative" and we want to uncheck that box.
          We now designate two cells that represent variables we can change.

          Solver produces the same answer.  The best fitting line is

          Before we can use partial derivatives to find a best fitting line,
          we need a function whose derivatives we are taking.
          We start with the chart we produced when we were using solver.
          This gives a formula for the squared error at each point in terms of the slope and intercept of the line.

          We can expand the error squared term and add up those values.
          After a straightforward but tedious computation, we see that we are trying to minimize
          <me>\operatorname{SumErrorSq}(m,b)=84m^2+28mb+3b^2-62b-364m+451</me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          We take the partial derivative of this function with respect to the slope <m>m</m> and the intercept <m>b</m>.

            <mrow>\operatorname{SumErrorSq}_m (m,b) \amp = 168m+28b-364</mrow>

          </md>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Setting the two partials to zero and solving we see the partials are both zero when <m>m=2</m> and <m>b=1</m>.
          One again, this method produces the same best fitting line.

          We set up a spreadsheet in the same way we set it up in the last example.
          For an initial slope we will start with 1.1 for 10% growth.
          For a starting point we will guess an intercept of 0.
          As we did in the last example, the predicted population in 2010 is the slope times the population in 2000 plus the intercept.
          We add extra columns for the predicted population,
          the error between the prediction and the actual population, the square of the error.
          At the bottom of the last column, we add the squared errors.
          This gives the value we want to minimize.

          When we use solver, the best fitting line is
          <me>\text{2010population}=1.096*\text{2000population}+98,154</me>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      The advantage of using the sum of squares definition is that we can find a best fitting curve using a model not supported by Excel.
      For example, if we have money invested with interest,
      but a portion of the capital kept available as cash without earning interest,
      we are looking for a curve of the form:
      <me>\TotalValue(\Time)=\CashAmount+\DepositAmount*\rate^{\Time}</me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <c>trendline</c> command does not let us choose such a model to find a best fitting curve.
      It is straightforward using the best fit construction.

      <title>Strengths and weaknesses of the three methods of fitting curves</title>

      <p>
        We have examined three methods for finding a best fitting curve.
        From <xref ref="chap-1-FunctionsGraphsExcel"/>, we reviewed the method of plotting points and adding a trendline.
        Using the sum of least squared error definition of best fit, we looked at creating an error function and using Solver to minimize the error.
        We also looked at using partial derivatives to find critical points of the error function.
        It is worthwhile to look at some of the strengths and weaknesses of each method.
      </p>

      <p>
        The method of graphing points and using the <c>trendline</c> command has the advantage of being the simplest method when it works.
        The biggest disadvantage of this method is that it only works with a small collection of mathematical models.
        (We can use this method if our desired equation is linear, <m>y=mx+b</m>,
        logarithmic, <m>y=a \log(x)+b</m>, polynomial of degree no more than 6,
        power, <m>y=ax^b</m>, or exponential, <m>y=ae^{bx}</m>.)
        As we have seen in this section, it is not hard to find situations where some other model should be used.
        This method also has the disadvantage of simply giving an answer without showing intermediate steps that might provide other useful information.
      </p>

      <p>
        The method of using partial derivatives has the advantage of being mathematically clear.
        It shows us what is going on when we find a best fitting curve.
        However, in all but the simplest cases, this method has the disadvantage of involving a daunting flood of computations.
        This method is good for informing us about how the method works,
        but not a method we want to use in practice for most realistic problems.
      </p>

      <p>
        The middle method, using Solver, is a hybrid of the other two methods.
        We start by deciding on the mathematical model that should fit our situation.
        As we saw, the method is straightforward to adapt to any kind of equation.
        It is straightforward to explicitly build our error function.
        This method also has the advantage of making the error attributed to each point visible.
        We can see if another curve is almost as good as the solution we find.
      </p>

      <p>
        The disadvantages of the Solver method are the standard disadvantages of using Solver to find a minimum.
        Recall that Solver simply finds a local minimum from a starting point.
        Since solver uses numerical methods it looks for places where the partial derivatives are within our tolerance bounds of zero.
        We cannot expect Solver to give an answer that is more precise than the tolerance bounds.
        With all of the methods we should be aware that we need enough points to get a reasonable fit of the curve.
        Intuitively, a small change in any point should not cause a big change in the curve.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a general rule, we will use the <c>trendline</c> command when it works with the kind of equation we have decided to use as our model.

              A scatter plot of the data will help us find some good initial guesses for the initial amount and the rate.

            <p>
              The <m>y</m>-intercept is about $5000. This occurs when time = 0,
              so the initial guess for the initial amount will be 5,000.
              The graph is an increasing function, so we know rate  <m>\gt 1</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Choosing <m>\rate = 1</m> will cause problems (the base of an exponential function should not be 1).
              Assuming this is a reasonable investment problem we will assume 5$ growth, so <m>r = 1.05</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              The initial set-up looks like this. We have included a graph of the data given versus the predicted numbers.
              The initial guesses are not bad, but clearly we can do better.
            </p>

            <image width="100%" source="images/sec6-4-sol5b.png"/>

            <p>After using Solver we determine that the best model function for our data is as follows:</p>

            <image width="100%" source="images/sec6-4-sol5c.png"/>

            <p>
              <me>\Amount(\Time)=5,013.11* (1.06)^{\Time}</me>.
              Notice that the data is now indistinguishable from the model function in the graph.
            </p>

            <p>
              Remark: If we use Trendlines to find a exponential function that fits the data, we would get <m>y=5001 e^{0.0583*time}</m>.
              The least square error analysis shows that this is not as good of an approximation as the one we just found using Solver!
              The least squares error for the trendline is approximately 30% greater than for the value we found using Solver.

              <me>\Amount(\Time)=\Amount_1+\Return_1*\Time+\Amount_2*{\rate_2}^{\Time}</me>.
            </p>

          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              The function we are looking for has a linear component (<m>\Amount_1+\Return_1*|time</m>), and an exponential component.
              There is no trendline that would do this for us.
            </p>

            <p>What do we know about these values?
              <ul>
                <li><p>We have $10,000 at the very beginning and this is split into two different investments, so Amount 1 + Amount 2 = $10,000. </p></li>
                <li><p>What is Return 1? It should be the return on the first part of the investment. So it should be some amount we receive on an investment of at most $10,000. A first guess would be that the value is in the hundreds of dollars, but maybe close to $150 or $200?</p></li>
                <li><p>The rate is our final parameter. This is the growth due to interests. We will start with a guess of <m>rate = 1.05</m>.</p></li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>The Excel commands used to generate the table are as follows:</p>

            <image width="100%" source="images/sec6-4-sol7a.png"/>

            <p>It is worth graphing both the actual data and the predicted data to see if we are setting the problem up correctly.</p>

            <image width="100%" source="images/sec6-4-sol7b.png"/>

            <p>The general shape of the predicted values graph seems fine. The values are off, but Solver will be able to reduce the error.</p>

            <image width="100%" source="images/sec6-4-sol7c.png"/>

            <p>The solution is:</p>

            <tabular top="major" halign="center">
              <row bottom="minor">
                <cell>Amount 1</cell>
                <cell>3317.59</cell>
              </row>
              <row bottom="minor">
                <cell>return 1</cell>
                <cell>163.19</cell>
              </row>
              <row bottom="minor">
                <cell>rate </cell>
                <cell>1.07</cell>
              </row>
            </tabular>

            <p>
              Hence <m>\Amount_2 = 10,000 - 3,317.59 = 6,682.41</m>, and we have that
              <me>\Amount(\Time)=\$3,317.59+\$163.19*\Time+\$6,682.41* (1.07)^{\Time}</me>.
            </p>

            <p>In Excel the data and the predicted values now line up very nicely.</p>

              John has divided his money between two accounts.
              They both compound their returns, but they pay different rates.
              Thus, the formula that models the investment is:
              <me>\Amount(\Time)=\Amount_1*\rate_1^{\Time}+\Amount_2*\rate2^{\Time}</me>.

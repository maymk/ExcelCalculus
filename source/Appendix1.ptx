                    <term>Basic Arithmetic in a cell</term> - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and exponentiation are done with <c>+</c>, <c>1</c> , <c>*</c>, <c>/</c>, and <c>^</c>.  The variable is replaced by a cell reference.  Multiplication needs to be explicit.  (We need <c>x*y</c>) rather than <c>xy</c>.)  Raising to a power of <c>e</c> is done with the <c>EXP()</c> function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One feature to remember is that Excel uses a slightly different order of operations compared to what is used in all math classes.  Excel interprets <c>-5^2</c> as <c>(-5)^2</c> rather than <c>-(5^2)</c>.

                    <term>Relative and absolute references</term> - When Copying formulae from one cell to another, either with copy and paste, or with quick-fill,
                    it is important to understand relative and absolute cell references. Suppose we are moving a formula from cell <c>A1</c> to cell <c>B3</c>.  (We are going one column over and two rows down.) A relative reference changes with the formula location. <c>=F5</c> becomes <c>=G7</c>.
                    An absolute reference stays the same and has dollar signs, <c>$</c>, to fix an index. For the same move, <c>=$F$5</c> stays <c>=$F$5</c>.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can also fix either the rows or columns by using dollar signs, <c>$</c>.  Moving from cell <c>A1</c> to cell <c>B3</c>, the formula <c>=F$5</c> becomes <c>=G$5</c> and <c>=$F5</c> becomes <c>=$F7</c>

            <ul>
                <li><p><term>Graph a function</term> 
                    We graph a function in Excel by first making a table of input and output values.  We then select the values for both the x and y values, then select the button to insert a scatter plot.  The most common error is to only selct the output, in which case Excel assumes the sequence 1, 2, 3, ... is the input. 
                        <xref ref="BasicGraphVideo"> A screencast of the production of a graph of a simple function. </xref>

                <li><p><term>Graph multiple functions</term> 
                        Two graph multiple functions we start with a chart that has the input and the output of the multiple functions,  Select the column for the input and the outputs to be graphed and then insett a scatterplot.  If the input variable is not included, Excel will interpret the first output varaiable as the input and give a very different graoph. If the input and functions are not next to each other in the table, you need to right click (control-click on a Mac) to select cells that are not adjacent.

                <li><p><term>Use a secondary axis.</term>
                         If the scales of the graphs are noticably differnt we want to use a secondary axis for one of the graphs.  For example is we are graphung <m>f(x)=x^2</m> and <m>g(x)=x^5</m> for the interval <m>[-10,10]</m>, the scale of <m>g(x)</m> is so large that we cannot see what happens fith <m>f(x)</m>.  To use a secondary axis, double click a point and then select secondary axis from the axes tab.

                         We can add parameters to the table we are creating to either look at a variety of curves or to change the domain of the graph.  Parameters and values that will be used throguhout the table are written as absolute references.

            <!-- you can't have an introduction if you're not going to have a subsection -->
            <!-- <introduction> -->
                <p>
                    Goal Seek is a tool for <term>What If Analysis</term>.  Given a formula <m> f(x)=y</m>, it asks what value of <m>x</m>  will produce a desired value of <m>y</m>.  It should be noted that, by defualt, it thinks values are equal if within 0.001 of each other.
                </p>
            <!-- </introduction> -->
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>To find <term>Goal Seek</term>, 
                        select the "Data" tab, then select the "What-If Analysis" menu and the "Goal Seek" item.  You need to identify an input cell with a number in to be the variable to change.  You also need to identify an output cell to that contains a formula that depend on the input cell.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In terms of screenshots we have a <xref ref="LinearGoalSeekSetup">starting point</xref> where the input is <c>A3</c> and the output is <c>B3</c> and the mune is visible in the menu bar.  After choosing Goal Seek we are presented with a <xref ref="LinearGoalSeekMenu"> Goal Seek menu </xref> where we identify the input and output cells and the desired vaule of the output.  Excel responds with the <xref ref="LinearGoalSeekResult"> desired results</xref>.  There is also a screencast of the <xref ref="LinearGoalSeekVideo">Goal Seek example</xref>.

                    <p>
                        We often want to use Goal Seek to find the <xref ref="IntersectionGoalSeekVideo">intersection of two curves</xref>.We simply define the difference of the fuunctions as a new formula and ust it for the output.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><p><term>Avoiding traps of Goal Seek</term> 
                    Since Goal Seek finds results numerically, using a variant of Newton's method, there are several cautions to keep in mind:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Goal Seek thinks two values are equal when they are within 0.001 of each other.  It will produce an answer to <m>\frac{1}{x^4}=0</m>.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Goal seek works best when given a starting point close to an actual solution.  On a function with several solutions, different starting points lead to different solutions.
                                </p>

                                    Goal seek is confused by corners and discontinuities.
